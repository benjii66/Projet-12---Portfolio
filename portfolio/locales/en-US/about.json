    "aboutParagraph": "I am a junior web developer with a passion for crafting interactive and responsive web applications. My journey into web development began with a background in gameplay programming from my time in a game development school, where I gained proficiency in C# and C++. In my current role, I have honed my skills in JavaScript, React, Node.js, MySQL, Next.js, HTML, and CSS. I am particularly enthusiastic about exploring new technologies and frameworks, and I have recently delved into React and Redux. My curiosity and eagerness to learn have driven me to continuously expand my knowledge and skill set. Outside of coding, I am an avid rock climber, finding joy in the challenge and problem-solving aspect of the sport. I am excited about the prospect of joining an apprenticeship in React in the future. As a team player, I thrive in collaborative environments and am eager to contribute my skills and creativity to building amazing applications alongside like-minded professionals.",
